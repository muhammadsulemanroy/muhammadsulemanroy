## My Journey

My learning journey began at SkipQ organization, where I immersed myself in a boot camp. After 5 months of dedication, I gained foundational skills in MERN stack development. Following my progress, I embarked on an internship at Cyberevangelists, a tech company based in Lahore, Pakistan. My time there further honed my skills and introduced me to the practical world of MERN stack development.

Currently, I'm a junior MERN stack developer at Adroittech, a remote-working company headquartered in Germany. This role has allowed me to continue learning and applying my skills on an international stage.
